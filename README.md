I'm a passionate software developer from India with expertise in Python and Django, currently expanding my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms. My journey in tech is driven by a keen interest in AI and Machine Learning, coupled with a commitment to creating impactful digital solutions.

My experience includes Django Web-development projects and an internship at Cybercrime Police Station. As a recent graduate, I'm eager to dive deeper into the world of AI and ML while continuing to grow as a developer.

I thrive on connecting with like-minded professionals and am always open to new opportunities that align with my interests in Software Development, AI, and Cybersecurity. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together!
